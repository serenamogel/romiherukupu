style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Unlock the Sluice Gate in Baldur's Gate 3 by strategically manipulating valves on a platform to gain access to a sewage conduit.<h2>Sluice Gate Vault in BG3</h2><p>The Sluice Gate serves as a substantial entrance into a sewage conduit, accessible through a unique mechanism. To unlock this gate, one must engage with various valves positioned on a platform situated above ground level. This interactive process entails manipulating the valves to regulate water and temperature levels.</p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p>Successfully coordinating these valves prompts the gate to open, granting access to the sewage pipe beyond. The valves' careful manipulation is necessary to avoid the release of harmful elements from the gauges. Ultimately, the task demands precision in synchronizing the valves' actions to achieve the desired effect. This dynamic interaction introduces an intriguing challenge in gaining entry through the Sluice Gate and venturing further into the sewage pipe.</p><h2>How to Open the Sluice Gate vault in BG3?</h2><p>To open the Sluice Gate vault in Baldur's Gate 3, follow these detailed steps:</p><p><strong>Locate the Note: </strong>First, make your way to the platform above the Sluice Gate. Here, you'll find a note attached to one of the pipes. This note provides crucial information on how to open the vault.</p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p><strong>Understand the Mechanism: </strong>The note explains that the water and temperature valves need to be adjusted simultaneously to their optimal levels for the Sluice Gate to open. There are two valves on the platform: the water valve on the left and the temperature valve on the right.</p><p><strong>Observe the Gauges:</strong> Next to each valve, there's a gauge displaying two colors, blue/red and green. Your objective is to align the pointers of both gauges within the middle of the green section.</p><p>Execute the Process:</p><p>a. Water Valve: Begin with a single character. Interact with the water valve by clicking it once. This action starts the water gauge's ascent, and a timer is displayed on the valve.</p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p>b. Timing: Wait for a few seconds to let the water gauge rise gradually. Take note of the speed at which the gauge progresses.</p><p>c. Temperature Valve: Move your character to the temperature valve after the water gauge has been activated. Click the temperature valve once to initiate the temperature gauge's rise.</p><p>d. Synchronization: Because the temperature gauge increases faster than the water gauge, the goal is to time your actions in such a way that both gauges reach their optimal levels (the middle of the green space) at the same time.</p><p><strong>Be Cautious:</strong> During this process, be mindful of the gauges' progression. Prevent them from reaching the extreme ends of their scales. If they do, they'll release water or fire that can damage your characters.</p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p><strong>Reset Valve:</strong> Should you need to start over, you can use the reset valve situated on the far right of the platform to reset the gauges.</p><p><strong>Persistence and Success: </strong>It might take several attempts to get the timing right. Keep experimenting with the sequence and timing of valve activation.</p><p><strong>Vault Opens: </strong>Once you successfully synchronize both the water and temperature gauges to the green level simultaneously, the Sluice Gate vault will open. Proceed through the gate, but be prepared to face enemies on the other side.</p><p><strong>Minsc's Path: </strong>This path also leads to the area where you can recruit Minsc. Refer to a separate guide on recruiting Minsc for more information on how to achieve this.</p><h2>Baldur's Gate 3</h2><p>Baldur's Gate III is a role-playing video game that was developed and published by Larian Studios.
