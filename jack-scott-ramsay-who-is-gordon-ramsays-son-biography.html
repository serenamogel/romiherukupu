He is known best for being a celebrity chef, and the owner of the Gordon Ramsay Restaurants chain.</p><p>Gordon was raised alongside his three siblings in Stratford-upon-Avon, England by their father Gordon James Sr. who was a shopkeeper, welder and a swimming pool manager, and their mother Helen who was a nurse. The family often moved because James Sr. was an alcoholic and found it hard to keep a job. Gordon was 16 when he left home, and started working to financially support himself. He was 19 when he began attending North Oxfordshire Technical College, at which he studied hotel management.</p><p>When he was around 20, Gordon began working at the Wroxton House Hotel as a commis chef, but was fired after it was revealed that he was sleeping with the owner’s wife. After that, Gordon worked at various restaurants before being offered work at Harveys, owned by the famous chef and TV personality Marco Pierre White. He decided <a rel=nofollow href=#>to move to Paris</a> and learn about French cuisine, however, Marco managed to persuade Gordon to instead work at the restaurant Le Gavroche for the famous chef Albert Roux. Albert was more than satisfied with Gordon, and after only a year invited him to work alongside him at his ski resort in the French Alps.</p><p>He went on to work in France and learn about its cuisine for three years, before agreeing to work as a chef on the yacht Idlewild which took him to Sicily, Italy where Gordon learned about Italian cuisine.</p><p>Upon returning to London, Gordon started working for Marco Pierre White once again, as the head chef of his restaurant Aubergine in which he also had a 10 percent share. The restaurant receive two Michelin stars, however, Gordon left in July 1998 because he wasn’t getting along with the business owners. He opened his own restaurant in the same year called Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and by 2001 it had received three Michelin stars. Gordon opened many other restaurants around the world, including two in Tokyo in 2005 and one in New York City in November 2006.

In 1999 he was featured in the documentary series “Boiling Point”, then in the 2000 “Beyond Boiling Point”. He was cast to appear in the series “Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares” in 2004, while the same year saw him star in the more popular show “Hell’s Kitchen”, in which he trained celebrities to become chefs.
