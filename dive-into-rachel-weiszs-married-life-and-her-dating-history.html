An Oscar winner, Weisz is one of the most decorated actresses in Hollywood. Rachel earned the honor throughout her three-decade-long career. However, do you know her about her love life?&nbsp;</p><p>Weisz, 53, London-born and Cambridge-educated, became a naturalized American after marrying an American icon. Rachel exchanged her vows with none other than <strong>Daniel Craig</strong>. Her personal life comes under the media's soft scrutiny as the actress makes a heartbreaking revelation. &nbsp;</p><h2>Rachel Weisz's Experienced a Miscarriage! &nbsp;</h2><p>Rachel Weisz isn't about broadcasting her matters to assert her celebrity status. The London-born actress is known to keep it on the low. So, when she did decide to open up about a topic as sensitive as miscarriage, of course, it blew up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/18/341546965_1452846688790648_4237787888332414130_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684422098872.jpg><p><i>The Mummy</i> actress recently revealed that she and her husband, Daniel Craig, suffered a miscarriage.

Weisz and her loving partner, Daniel, exchanged their vows in 2011. Moreover, Craig and Rachel shared said intimate moment away from the peering eyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/18/270012885_660764238679096_2909735152600742686_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684422107013.jpg><p>The pair Weisz and Craig were friends for many years. But they decided to change the nature of their relationship. As per the few reports that are available on the powerful, yet reticent couple, they had known each other for years before working together. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rachel and Daniel were friends for many years before they turned romantic!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The first onscreen association of Weisz and Craig goes back to 2010. The pair played onscreen spouses in the psychological thriller film, <i>Dream House.</i> According to their fellow co-stars, they share this palpable chemistry that was meant to be translated into real life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The brunette beauty and the <i>James Bond</i> franchise actor started dating the same year and walked <a href=#>down the aisle</a> on <i>June 22, 2011</i>, in the most intimate way possible; reportedly, only four people attended their wedding. Rachel gave birth to a daughter in September 2018 with her husband, Daniel.</p><h3>Rachel's Married Life and Journey with Daniel Craig!</h3><p>Over the years, the talented pair have turned into colleagues numerous times. In a marriage as tightly wrapped as theirs, it's hard to presume if the ship is sailing smoothly or with bumps, but taking it from their rare testimonies, the pair are applying the approach they think will best protect their marriage. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/18/329760261_222934636871579_8390513296979937884_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684422435799.jpg><p>In one of her rare candid interviews, the Oscar winner shares that the duo keeping it extremely low profile is for the betterment of their marriage. "He's just too famous. You have to protect your marriage," Weisz explained. Craig, 55, on his part, also concurs with his wife's decision to put a wall around their personal lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Get to Know Rachel Weisz's Husband, Daniel Craig! &nbsp;</h3><p>Although the man needs no introduction, here's some anyway. In 2005, Craig succeeded many legends like <strong>Sean Connery, Roger Moore,</strong> and <strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong> to play the fictional handsome secret agent Bond, in <i>Casino Royale.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/18/54512872_528019870938810_1077804468283842353_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684422114631.jpg><p>Craig's casting was initially met with flaming criticism from fans who thought he wasn't the right fit. But following the record-breaking success of <i>Casino Royale</i>, and the four subsequent sequels that followed, the latest being, <i>No Time to Die</i>, Craig has become the evergreen poster boy of the franchise. &nbsp;</p><p>Besides his decade-spanning association with the Bond franchise, &nbsp;Daniel is known for his award-winning roles in <i>The Trench, Enduring Love, Knives Out</i>, and <i>Some Voices</i>. &nbsp;</p><p>Craig had been married once before he got hitched for the second time to Rachel.
