Nevertheless, since metal braces are compact and composed of lightweight metals such as titanium or stainless steel, they will not set off the majority of metal detectors at airports and other locations.</p><p></p><h3>Is it okay for me to consume doughnuts while wearing braces?</h3><p>–Avoid foods that are sticky or high in sugar. Even if you don’t have orthodontic braces, limiting your intake of hard (nerds), sticky (milkduds), and gummy candies, white bread, doughnuts, oreos, and other processed foods is a smart idea. These sticky and acidic foods will get stuck between the orthodontic brackets and wires when the patient is wearing orthodontic brackets and wires.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it okay for me to eat a cheeseburger while wearing braces?</h3><p>The good news is that you can consume a wide variety of delicious foods while wearing braces.

Foods that are firm or chewy should be avoided if you wear braces, according to the general rule of thumb. These kinds of foods have the potential to cause wire breakage.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it okay for me to consume pancakes and syrup while wearing braces?</h3><p>Pancakes, waffles, and muffins (without nuts) are all included on the list of foods that are safe to consume while wearing braces.
